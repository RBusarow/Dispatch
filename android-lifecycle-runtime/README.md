# dispatch-android-lifecycle-runtime

### Api

#### One-time suspend functions

Examples

```Kotlin
import dispatch.android.*

// This could be any LifecycleOwner -- Fragments, Activities, Services...
class SomeScreen : Fragment() {

  init {

    // auto-created MainImmediateCoroutineScope which is lifecycle-aware
    lifecycleScope. //...

    // active only when "resumed".  starts a fresh coroutine each time
    // this is a rough proxy for LiveData behavior
    lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed {  }

    // active only when "started".  starts a fresh coroutine each time
    lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted {  }

    // launch when created, automatically stop on destroy
    lifecycleScope.launchWhenCreated {  }

    // it works as a normal CoroutineScope as well (because it is)
    lifecycleScope.launchMain {  }

  }
}

class SomeApplication : Application() {
  override fun onCreate() {
    super.onCreate()
    // A custom factory can be set to add elements to the CoroutineContext
    LifecycleScopeFactory.set { MainImmediateCoroutineScope() + SomeCustomElement() }
  }
}

class SomeEspressoTest {
  @Before
  fun setUp() {
    // This custom factory can be used to use custom scopes for testing,
    // such as an idling dispatcher
    LifecycleScopeFactory.set { MainImmediateIdlingCoroutineScope() }
  }

  @After
  fun tearDown() {
    // The factory can also be reset to default
    LifecycleScopeFactory.reset()
  }
}
```

### Isn't this just AndroidX?

This module is really just a slightly different version of [androidx-lifecycle-runtime-ktx][androidx-lifecycle-runtime-ktx] â€” the library which gives us the [lifecycleScope][lifecycleScope] property.

Why not just use AndroidX?  Because we need two things it doesn't offer.

### Custom CoroutineScope factories

The way `androidx-lifecycle-runtime` constructs its [CoroutineScope][coroutineScope] is [hard-coded][lifecycleScope], which eliminates the possibility of using a custom [CoroutineContext][coroutineContext] such as a `DispatcherProvider` or [IdlingDispatcher][idlingDispatcher]. With `dispatch.android.lifecycle`, we can set a custom factory.

```Kotlin
class SomeFragmentEspressoTest() {

  // Not part of this artifact.  see dispatch-android-espresso
  @JvmField @Rule val idlingRule = IdlingDispatcherProviderRule()

  @Before
  fun setUp() {
    // set a custom factory which is applied to all newly created lifecycleScopes
    LifecycleScopeFactory.set {
      MainImmediateCoroutineScope() + idlingRule.dispatcherProvider
    }

    // now SomeFragment will use an IdlingDispatcher in its CoroutineScope
  }
}
```

### Automatic start/stop/restart of "observer" jobs

Structured concurrency relies upon cancellation, but [androidx-lifecycle-runtime.ktx][androidx-lifecycle-runtime-ktx] doesn't cancel.  It uses a special [PausingDispatcher][pausingDispatcher]. This pausing behavior then **leaks** upstream, creating backpressure and potentially deadlocks.

There's a [bug filed in their issue tracker][b/146370660], but 2.2.0 got released anyway.

This library's API surface is the same as that within the AndroidX version, but has a different strategy for handling lifecycle events.  When a lifecycle state enters the desired range, such as at `ON_RESUME`, a new coroutine is created.  When the state exists the range, that coroutine is *cancelled*. If the lifecycle state enters the desired range again, a **new** coroutine is created.

```Kotlin
import dispatch.android.*

class SomeFragment : Fragment() {

  val viewModel: SomeViewModel by viewModels()

  init {
    // automatically created CoroutineScope using the factory described above
    lifecycleScope.launchWhenResumed {
      viewModel.someFlow.consume {  }
    }
  }

}
```

This has the desired effect of not leaking backpressure upstream (which in this example is the `viewModel`).

### Future plans

This artifact exists primarily as a solution to the bug, but also for the sake of the factory.  I'll be working to make this change in AndroidX as well, since it has value even outside of `DispatcherProvider`.  But I can get it released and usable a lot faster in my own project, so here we are.

I will maintain this artifact until the pausing bug is fixed in production AndroidX and it has a settable factory, or some other suitable solution for custom scopes.

### Getting the artifact

in your project `build.gradle`:

```Groovy
dependencies {

  // core is required
  implementation 'com.rickbusarow.dispatch:dispatch-core:$version'

  implementation 'com.rickbusarow.dispatch:dispatch-dispatch-android-lifecycle-runtime:$version'
}
```
